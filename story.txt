Once upon a time there was guy named John. John was a student at the University of Madison. John liked to enjoy the cityand go to the art mueseum every weekend.
Starting spring semester 2019, John decided to take CS400 - a computer science course in which he will learn Java. However, he were swamped with homeworks and projects which exhaust all of his lively spirit. 
This is a really simple story. Different CS people select different course to study. Some of them select operating system, and others choose machine learning.
